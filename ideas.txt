  id int, auto increment
  cid int // Class ID

Errors given from /checkin :
  1: Student not found
  2: Too long till next class
  3: Student is already attending his/her current (or next < 15 minutes) class.
  4: No class for today anymore (schedule item not found)
  5: Student tries to check into the wrong class 
      (studentâ€™s class is in BA6.43, but he/she tries to check into BA6.49 for example)

To do:
+For /api/attendee?ciid=21 don't send students that were created after ciid's class started. 
  Save yrwk of when student was created in db table student. I don't think saving the full unixTime adds much value.
  In att.FetchAll when fetching students that did not attent, 
	do relationship-stuff to only fetch students that apply: s.created >= ci.yrwk.
+Classes that are in unknown rooms can't be checked-in.
